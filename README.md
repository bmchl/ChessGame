# ChessGame

hello! this is the fully playable full-stack chess game i developed using c++ and qt. 
this game served as the final project of my class in winter 2022, and made use of all the notions we learned throughout the semester including **inheritance**, **abstract classes** and **virtual methods**, as well as **static variables** and **thrown exceptions**. 

## Screenshots
